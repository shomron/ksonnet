Parameters are customizable fields that are used inside ksonnet *component*
manifests. Examples might include a deployment's 'name' or 'image'. Parameters
can also be defined on a *per-environment* basis. (Environments are ksonnet
deployment targets, e.g. specific clusters. For more info, run ` + "`ks env --help`" + `.)

For example, this allows a ` + "`dev`" + ` and ` + "`prod`" + ` environment to use the same component
manifest for an nginx deployment, but customize ` + "`prod`" + ` to use more replicas to meet
heavier load demands.

Params are structured as follows:

* App params (stored in ` + "`components/params.libsonnet`" + `)
    * Component-specific params
        * Originally populated from ` + "`ks generate`" + `
        * e.g. 80 for ` + "`deployment-example.port`" + `
    * Global params
        * Out of scope for CLI (requires Jsonnet editing)
        * Use to make a variable accessible to multiple components (e.g. service name)

* Per-environment params (stored in + ` + "`environments/<env-name>/params.libsonnet`" + `)
    * Component-specific params ONLY
    * Override app params (~inheritance)

Note that all of these params are tracked **locally** in version-controllable
Jsonnet files.
