The ` + "`diff`" + ` command displays standard file diffs, and can be used to compare manifests
based on *environment* or location ('local' ksonnet app manifests or what's running
on a 'remote' server).

Using this command, you can compare:

1. *Remote* and *local* manifests for a single environment
2. *Remote* manifests for two separate environments
3. *Local* manifests for two separate environments
4. A *remote* manifest in one environment and a *local* manifest in another environment

To see the official syntax, see the examples below. Make sure that your $KUBECONFIG
matches what you've defined in environments.

When NO component is specified (no ` + "`-c`" + ` flag), this command diffs all of
the files in the ` + "`components/`" + ` directory.

When a component IS specified via the ` + "`-c`" + ` flag, this command only checks
the manifest for that particular component.

### Syntax
`
	diffExample = `
# Show diff between remote and local manifests for a single 'dev' environment.
# This command diffs *all* components in the ksonnet app, and can be used in any
# of that app's subdirectories.
ks diff remote:dev local:dev

# Shorthand for the previous command (remote 'dev' and local 'dev')
ks diff dev

# Show diff between the remote resources running in two different ksonnet environments
# 'us-west/dev' and 'us-west/prod'. This command diffs all resources defined in
# the ksonnet app.
ks diff remote:us-west/dev remote:us-west/prod

# Show diff between local manifests in the 'us-west/dev' environment and remote
# resources in the 'us-west/prod' environment, for an entire ksonnet app
ks diff local:us-west/dev remote:us-west/prod

# Show diff between what's in the local manifest and what's actually running in the
# 'dev' environment, but for the Redis component ONLY
ks diff dev -c redis
