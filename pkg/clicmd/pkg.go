A ksonnet package contains:

* A set of prototypes (see ` + "`ks prototype --help`" + ` for more info on prototypes), which
generate similar types of components (e.g. ` + "`redis-stateless`" + `, ` + "`redis-persistent`" + `)
* Associated helper libraries that define the prototype parts (e.g. ` + "`redis.libsonnet`" + `)

Packages allow you to easily distribute and reuse code in any ksonnet application.
Packages come from registries, such as Github repositories. (For more info, see
` + "`ks registry --help`" + `).

To be recognized and imported by ksonnet, packages need to follow a specific schema.
See the annotated file tree below, as an example:

` + "```" + `
.
├── README.md                      // Human-readable description of the package
├── parts.yaml                     // Provides metadata about the package
├── prototypes                     // Can be imported and used to generate components
│   ├── redis-all-features.jsonnet
│   ├── redis-persistent.jsonnet
│   └── redis-stateless.jsonnet
└── redis.libsonnet                // Helper library, includes prototype parts
