Use the` + " `prototype` " + `subcommands to manage, inspect, instantiate, and get
examples for ksonnet prototypes.

Prototypes are pre-written but incomplete Kubernetes manifests, with "holes"
(parameters) that can be filled in with the ksonnet CLI or manually. For example,
the prototype` + " `io.ksonnet.pkg.single-port-deployment` " + `requires a name and image,
and the ksonnet CLI can expand this into a fully-formed 'Deployment' object.

These complete manifests are output into your ` + "`components/`" + ` directory. In other
words, prototypes provide the basis for the **components** of your app. You can
use prototypes to autogenerate boilerplate code and focus on customizing them
for your use case.
